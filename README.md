##Neighborhood Map: California Golf Courses

Link TODO: http://jpetersun.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-neighborhood-map/

A map of 11 golf courses nearby my city. I made use of the Yelp API to populate infowindows with locations, ratings, reviews, pictures, and addresses.

A search bar filters the golf courses by name. Clicking on the list will open the locations corresponding marker's infowindow. The markers can be clicked as well to display
the infowindow with the Yelp content about that location.
